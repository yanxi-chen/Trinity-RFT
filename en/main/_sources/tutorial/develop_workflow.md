## Workflow Development Guide

In Trinity-RFT, workflows are the core components that define the interaction between Agents and Environments.
A qualified workflow needs to use a model to complete the specified task and obtain feedback information (reward) from the environment. Below are the steps to create a new workflow:

---

### Step 0: Basic Concepts

Before starting development, it's important to understand several core concepts:

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
    A([Task]) & B([Model]) --> C[Workflow]
    C --> D([Experience])
```

- **Task** ({class}`trinity.common.workflows.Task`): Represents a data structure that contains all the information needed for a single run of the workflow. Commonly provided by the training dataset, each sample in the dataset is converted into a `Task` instance. The content of the `Task` varies depending on the task type:
  - **Math problems**: A `Task` contains the problem description and the golden answer.
  - **Programming scenarios**: A `Task` includes the problem description, test cases, runtime environment, and other complex information.

- **Model** ({class}`trinity.common.models.model.ModelWrapper`): The model being trained. The workflow uses this model to generate responses based on the task. Trinity-RFT will provide the model instance to initialize the workflow.

- **Workflow** ({class}`trinity.common.workflows.Workflow`): It defines the interaction flow between Agents and Environments. It uses the `Task` to initialize itself and uses the `Model` to generate responses. Different from general Agent Applications, a `Workflow` also needs to calculate rewards based on the environment's feedback. Trinity-RFT provides several built-in workflows, including:
  - `MathWorkflow` ({class}`trinity.common.workflows.MathWorkflow`): For math scenarios, submits problems to LLM, parses LLM responses, and calculates scores (rewards).
  - `WebShopWorkflow` ({class}`trinity.common.workflows.WebShopWorkflow`): For webshop scenarios, it contains multi-turn interaction with environment.
  - `AgentScopeReActWorkflow` ({class}`trinity.common.workflows.AgentScopeReActWorkflow`): It directly uses a pre-implemented ReActAgent (based on AgentScope) to solve tasks.

- **Experience** ({class}`trinity.common.experience.Experience`): The output of running a `Workflow`. The number and structure of `Experience` depend on the specific workflow. For example, for common PPO/GRPO algorithms, `Experience` includes lists of token IDs, action masks (identifying which tokens were generated by the LLM), log probabilities, rewards, etc.


---

### Step 1: Prepare Task Dataset

The task dataset is loaded via the `buffer.explorer_input.taskset` configuration entry in your YAML config file.
To handle differences in `Task` contents, Trinity-RFT provides a unified `Task` interface containing the following fields.

- **`workflow`** (`str`): The registered name of your workflow class. You can specify it in `buffer.explorer_input.taskset.default_workflow_type` of your YAML config file.
- **`reward_fn`** (`Optional[str]`): The registered name of your reward function. You can specify it in `buffer.explorer_input.taskset.default_reward_fn_type`. Note that some workflows already include built-in reward calculation; in such cases, you can omit this field.
- **`raw_task`** (`Dict`): A record of raw data in `Dict` format. For highly customized workflow, you can directly use `raw_task` to initialize your `Workflow` instance without relying on the following fields.
- **`format_args`** ({class}`trinity.common.config.FormatConfig`): Parameters to facilitate the construction of `Workflow` instances. For example, the `prompt_key` and `response_key` can be used to get the prompt and response from `raw_task`. These settings come from the YAML configuration file and can be set in `buffer.explorer_input.task_set.format`.
- **`rollout_args`** ({class}`trinity.common.config.GenerationConfig`): Parameters that control the rollout process, such as `temperature`. This field also comes from the YAML configuration file and can be set in `buffer.explorer_input.task_set.rollout_args`.
- **`workflow_args`** (`Dict`): A dictionary of parameters to facilitate the construction of `Workflow` instances. Provides more flexibility than `format_args` and `rollout_args` by using a dictionary. This field also comes from the YAML configuration file and can be set in `buffer.explorer_input.task_set.workflow_args`. Normally, you do not need to set this field.

```{tip}
`workflow`, `workflow_args` and `raw_task` provide different levels of customization.

- `workflow` provides the global settings for all tasks that uses the same workflow. (Global Level)
- `workflow_args` can be set for each task dataset, allowing different task datasets using the same workflow to behave differently. (Dataset Level)
- `raw_task` provides the ability to customize the behavior of each task, which is most flexible. (Data Sample Level)
```

In the math problem scenario, the `Task` dataset can be a `jsonl` file, where each line contains JSON with `question` and `answer` fields representing the problem description and standard answer, respectively. For example:

```json
{"question": "1+1=", "answer": "2"}
{"question": "2+2=", "answer": "4"}
...
```

Example configuration snippet:

```yaml
# some config
buffer:
  explorer_input:
    taskset:
      default_workflow: "math_workflow"
      path: ${oc.env:TRINITY_TASKSET_PATH}
      format:
        prompt_key: "question"
        response_key: "answer"
      rollout_args:
        temperature: 1.0
      # some other configs
```

In this example, each task object's `raw_task` is a `Dict` with two keys (`question` and `answer`). The `MathWorkflow` uses the `prompt_key` and `response_key` to extract the question and answer from the `raw_task` and use the `rollout_args` to generate the response.

---

### Step 2: Implement a New Workflow

The `Workflow` base class interface is as follows:

```python
class Workflow(ABC):

    def __init__(
        self,
        *,
        task: Task,
        model: ModelWrapper,
        auxiliary_models: Optional[List[openai.OpenAI]] = None,
    ):
        self.task = task
        self.model = model
        self.auxiliary_models = auxiliary_models

    @abstractmethod
    def run(self) -> List[Experience]:
        """Run the workflow and return a list of Experiences."""
```

#### Initialize Your Workflow

During initialization, `Workflow` receives the following parameters:

- `task`({class}`trinity.common.workflows.Task`): A single data item from the task dataset.
- `model`({class}`trinity.common.models.model.ModelWrapper`): The model being trained, which provides an interface similar to OpenAI, capable of receiving a list of conversation messages and returning content generated by the LLM (including reply text `response_text`, full sequence token ids `tokens`, prompt part token length `prompt_length`, and a list of output token logprobs `logprobs`).
- `auxiliary_models`(`List[openai.OpenAI]`):A list of auxiliary models not involved in training. All are provided via OpenAI-compatible APIs.

```{tip}
You can switch to using the OpenAI API by setting `explorer.rollout_model.enable_openai_api` to `true` in your config file and calling `model.get_openai_client()` to get an `openai.OpenAI` instance in your workflow.
And the `model` field when calling openai API can be obtained via `openai_client.models.list().data[0].id` or `openai_client.model_path`.
```

Here's an example of initializing a simple workflow using only `raw_task` and `rollout_args`. In more complex cases, you can use the `format_args` for further customization.

```python
class ExampleWorkflow(Workflow):

    def __init__(self, task: Task, model: ModelWrapper, auxiliary_models: List):
        super().__init__(task=task, model=model, auxiliary_models=auxiliary_models)
        self.question = task.raw_task.get("question")
        self.answer = task.raw_task.get("answer")
        self.rollout_args = task.rollout_args
        # Optional: If you want to use OpenAI API in your workflow
        # self.openai_client = self.model.get_openai_client()
```

#### Implementing the `run` method

The `run` method is the core of your workflow. It returns a list of `Experience`.
Below is a simple implementation for a math workflow.

We first call the model to generate a response using the provided question and rollout arguments.
Then we calculate the reward for each response using the `calculate_reward` function.
Finally, we construct a list of `Experience` with the responses and rewards and return it.

```python
class ExampleWorkflow(Workflow):

    # the __init__ function

    def calculate_reward(self, response: str, truth: str) -> float:
        if response == truth:
            return 1.0
        else:
            return 0.0

    def run(self) -> List[Experience]:
        # call the model to generate multiple responses
        responses = self.model.chat(
            [
                {
                    "role": "user",
                    "content": f"Question:\n{self.question}",
                }
            ],
            temperature=self.rollout_args.temperature,
        )
        response = responses[0]  # there is only one response
        reward: float = self.calculate_reward(response.response_text, self.answer)
        return [
            Experience(
                tokens=response.tokens,
                prompt_length=response.prompt_length,
                reward=reward,
                logprobs=response.logprobs,
            )
        ]
```

#### Registering Your Workflow

Register your workflow using the `WORKFLOWS.register_module` decorator.
Ensure the name does not conflict with existing workflows.

```python
# import some packages
from trinity.common.workflows.workflow import WORKFLOWS

@WORKFLOWS.register_module("example_workflow")
class ExampleWorkflow(Workflow):
    pass
```

For workflows that are prepared to be contributed to Trinity-RFT project, you need to place the above code in `trinity/common/workflows` folder, e.g., `trinity/common/workflows/example_workflow.py`. And add the following line to `trinity/common/workflows/__init__.py`:

```python
# existing import lines
from trinity.common.workflows.example_workflow import ExampleWorkflow

__all__ = [
    # existing __all__ lines
    "ExampleWorkflow",
]
```

#### Performance Optimization

##### Avoid Re-initialization

For heavy workflows, re-initializing every time can incurs extra computational costs.
In this case, you can set the `can_reset` property and implement `reset` method to avoid re-initialization.

The `can_reset` is a class property that indicates whether the workflow supports resetting.

The `reset` method accepts a `Task` parameter and resets the workflow's internal state based on the new task.

```python
@WORKFLOWS.register_module("example_workflow")
class ExampleWorkflow(Workflow):
    can_reset: bool = True

    # some code
    # ...

    def reset(self, task: Task):
        self.question = task.raw_task.get("question")
        self.answer = task.raw_task.get("answer")
```

##### Support Batch Inference

In many popular RL algorithms, multiple runs of the same task are required (e.g., GRPO). In such scenarios, you can directly use batch inference to obtain multiple responses for a single question to improve efficiency.
For this case, you can implement the `can_repeat` property and `set_repeat_times` method.

The `can_repeat` is a class property that indicates whether the workflow supports multiple executions within the `run` method.

The `set_repeat_times` method accepts two parameters: `repeat_times` specifies the number of times to execute within the `run` method, and `run_id_base` is an integer used to identify the first run ID in multiple runs (this parameter is used in multi-turn interaction scenarios; for tasks that can be completed with a single model call, this can be ignored).

```python
@WORKFLOWS.register_module("example_workflow")
class ExampleWorkflow(Workflow):
    can_repeat: bool = True
    # some code

    def set_repeat_times(self, repeat_times, run_id_base):
        self.repeat_times = repeat_times
        self.run_id_base = run_id_base

    def run(self) -> List[Experience]:
        # call the model to generate multiple responses
        responses = self.model.chat(
            [
                {
                    "role": "user",
                    "content": f"Question:\n{self.question}",
                }
            ],
            n=self.repeat_times,  # run multiple times in one call
            temperature=self.rollout_args.temperature,
        )
        experiences = []
        for response in responses:
            # calculate reward
            reward: float = self.calculate_reward(response.response_text, self.answer)
            # construct Experience
            experiences.append(
                Experience(
                    tokens=response.tokens,
                    prompt_length=response.prompt_length,
                    reward=reward,
                    logprobs=response.logprobs,
                )
            )
        return experiences
```


#### Full Code Example

```python
@WORKFLOWS.register_module("example_workflow")
class ExampleWorkflow(Workflow):
    can_reset: bool = True
    can_repeat: bool = True

    def __init__(self, task: Task, model: ModelWrapper, auxiliary_models: List):
        super().__init__(task=task, model=model, auxiliary_models=auxiliary_models)
        self.question = task.raw_task.get("question")
        self.answer = task.raw_task.get("answer")
        self.rollout_args = task.rollout_args

    def calculate_reward(self, response: str, truth: str) -> float:
        if response == truth:
            return 1.0
        else:
            return 0.0

    def run(self) -> List[Experience]:
        # call the model to generate multiple responses
        responses = self.model.chat(
            [
                {
                    "role": "user",
                    "content": f"Question:\n{self.question}",
                }
            ],
            n=self.rollout_args.n,
            temperature=self.rollout_args.temperature,
        )
        experiences = []
        for response in responses:
            # calulcate reward
            reward: float = self.calculate_reward(response.response_text, self.answer)
            # construct Experience
            experiences.append(
                Experience(
                    tokens=response.tokens,
                    prompt_length=response.prompt_length,
                    reward=reward,
                    logprobs=response.logprobs,
                )
            )
        return experiences

    def reset(self, task: Task):
        self.question = task.raw_task.get("question")
        self.answer = task.raw_task.get("answer")

    def set_repeat_times(self, repeat_times, run_id_base):
        self.repeat_times = repeat_times
        self.run_id_base = run_id_base
```

### Step 3: Use Your Workflow

After implementing and registering your workflow, you need to update the configuration file to set the `default_workflow_type` in the `buffer.explorer_input.taskset` domain to the newly registered `Workflow` name.

```yaml
buffer:
  # Other fields
  explorer_input:
    taskset:
      path: /path/to/taskset
      default_workflow_type: example_workflow
      # Other fields
```

Now you can run your workflow in Trinity-RFT using the command:

```
trinity run --config <your_yaml_file>
```

---

### Advanced Features

#### Async Support

The example above mainly targets synchronous mode. If your workflow needs to use asynchronous methods (e.g., asynchronous API), you can set `is_async` to `True`, then implement the `run_async` method. In this case, you no longer need to implement the `run` method, and the initialization parameter `auxiliary_models` will also change to `List[openai.AsyncOpenAI]`, while other methods and properties remain changed.

```python
@WORKFLOWS.register_module("example_workflow_async")
class ExampleWorkflowAsync(Workflow):

    is_async: bool = True

    async def run_async(self) -> List[Experience]:
        # your async code here

    # no need to implement run() method
```

#### Using OpenAI API

Trinity-RFT provides an option to use the OpenAI API for model inference. You can enable this feature by setting `explorer.rollout_model.enable_openai_api` to `true` in your configuration file.  This allows you to obtain an `openai.OpenAI` instance via the `get_openai_client` method of the model instance provided by Trinity-RFT.

Additionally, since the OpenAI API does not provide all the data required for training, you also need to set `explorer.rollout_model.enable_history` to `true`. This lets the framework automatically record data that can be used for training and convert it into a list of `Experience`. You can extract these experiences using the `extract_experience_from_history` method.

```yaml
# example config snippet
explorer:
  rollout_model:
    enable_openai_api: true
    enable_history: true
    # Other fields
```

```python
@WORKFLOWS.register_module("example_workflow")
class ExampleWorkflow(Workflow):

    def __init__(self, task: Task, model: ModelWrapper, auxiliary_models: List):
        super().__init__(task=task, model=model, auxiliary_models=auxiliary_models)
        self.model = model
        self.client: openai.OpenAI = self.model.get_openai_client()
        # or async client
        # self.client: openai.AsyncOpenAI = self.model.get_openai_async_client()
        self.agent = MyAgent(openai_client=self.client)

    def calculate_reward(self, response: str) -> float:
        # your reward calculation logic

    def run(self) -> List[Experience]:
        # run your agent
        response = self.agent.run()
        # calculate reward
        reward = self.calculate_reward(response)
        # extract experiences from history recorded in self.model
        experiences = self.model.extract_experience_from_history()
        for exp in experiences:
            exp.reward = reward
        return experiences
```


```{tip}
1. Currently, the OpenAI API will only automatically record calls to `openai.OpenAI.chat.completions.create` and `openai.AsyncOpenAI.chat.completions.create`, and convert them into `Experience` objects. Streaming output is not supported.
2. When calling `chat.completions.create`, the `model` field can be obtained via `openai_client.models.list().data[0].id` or `openai_client.model_path`.
3. For more complex workflow examples using the OpenAI API, refer to [ReAct Agent Training](./example_react.md).
```

#### LLM-as-a-judge Support

LLM-as-a-judge is a common reward calculation method, especially suitable for open-ended tasks (such as programming, writing, etc.). In these scenarios, the Workflow needs to leverage an additional LLM to evaluate the answer quality and compute the reward signal.

To support this, Trinity-RFT provides an Auxiliary Models mechanism. Auxiliary models are a set of models not involved in training; the Workflow can use these models to assist with tasks, such as acting as a judge to calculate rewards.

You can specify one or more auxiliary models in the configuration file via the `explorer.auxiliary_models` field. For example:

```yaml
explorer:
  auxiliary_models:
    - model_path: Qwen/Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct
      engine_num: 1
      tensor_parallel_size: 2
      enable_thinking: false
      max_prompt_tokens: 12288
      max_response_tokens: 12288
      max_model_len: 16384
    - model_path: Qwen/Qwen3-8B
      engine_num: 1
      tensor_parallel_size: 2
      enable_thinking: false
      max_prompt_tokens: 12288
      max_response_tokens: 12288
      max_model_len: 16384
```

Note that each auxiliary model will independently occupy `tensor_parallel_size * engine_num` GPUs. Please configure according to your hardware resources. After enabling auxiliary models, the number of GPUs available to the Trainer is the total GPU count minus those occupied by all auxiliary models and the inference model being trained (`rollout_model`).

The auxiliary models specified in the configuration file will automatically activate the OpenAI API and pass the corresponding `openai.OpenAI` or `openai.AsyncOpenAI` instances (depending on the `is_async` setting) to the `auxiliary_models` parameter of the `Workflow` initialization method. For example:

```python
class MyWorkflow(Workflow):
    def __init__(
        self,
        *,
        task: Task,
        model: ModelWrapper,
        auxiliary_models: Optional[List[openai.OpenAI]] = None,
    ):
        super().__init__(task=task, model=model, auxiliary_models=auxiliary_models)
        self.judge_model = self.auxiliary_models[0]  # Use the first auxiliary model as the judge

    def run(self) -> List[Experience]:
        response = self.do_something()
        reward_response = self.judge_model.chat.completions.create(
            model=self.judge_model.model_path,
            messages=[
                {
                    "role": "system",
                    "content": "You are a judge. You need to give a score from 0 to 1 based on the quality of the answer.",
                },
                {
                    "role": "user",
                    "content": f"Question:\n{self.task.raw_task['question']}\nAnswer:\n{response.response_text}\nPlease give a score from 0 to 1.",
                },
            ],
            temperature=0.0,
            max_tokens=10,
        )
        # Parse the reward score
        reward = float(reward_response.choices[0].message.content.strip())
        return [
            Experience(
                tokens=response.tokens,
                prompt_length=response.prompt_length,
                reward=reward,
                logprobs=response.logprobs,
            )
        ]
```


#### Debug Mode

During Workflow development, repeatedly launching the full training process for testing is time-consuming and inefficient. To address this, Trinity-RFT provides a Debug Mode for developers. This mode leverages a pre-launched inference model to quickly run specified workflows and obtain results, avoiding repeated model loading and initialization delays, and significantly improving development efficiency. The process is illustrated below:

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
    A[Start Inference Model] --> B[Debug Workflow]
    B --> B
```

To start the inference model, use the following command:

```bash
trinity debug --config <config_file_path> --module inference_model
```

Here, `<config_file_path>` is the path to a YAML configuration file, which should follow the same format as the one used by the `trinity run` command. The `explorer.rollout_model` and `explorer.auxiliary_models` fields in the config will be loaded to initialize the inference model.

Once started, the model will keep running and wait for debug instructions; it will not exit automatically. You can then run the following command in another terminal to debug your workflow:

```bash
trinity debug --config <config_file_path> --module workflow --output_file <output_file_path> --plugin_dir <plugin_dir>
```

- `<config_file_path>`: Path to the YAML configuration file, usually the same as used for starting the inference model.
- `<output_file_path>`: Path to save the performance profiling results. Debug Mode uses [viztracer](https://github.com/gaogaotiantian/viztracer) to profile the workflow execution and saves the results as an HTML file for easy viewing in a browser.
- `<plugin_dir>` (optional): Path to the plugin directory. If your workflow or reward function modules are not built into Trinity-RFT, you can specify this parameter to load custom modules.

During debugging, the `buffer.explorer_input.taskset` field in the config will be loaded to initialize the workflow's required task dataset and instance. Note that Debug Mode only reads the first sample in the dataset for testing. After running the above command, the workflow's return value will be automatically formatted and printed in the terminal for easy inspection.

When debugging is complete, you can terminate the inference model by pressing `Ctrl+C` in its terminal.
