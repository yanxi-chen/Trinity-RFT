### Overview

BOTS is a unified framework for **B**ayesian **O**nline **T**ask **S**election in LLM reinforcement finetuning.

BOTS operates in a continuous loop of task selection, model training, and posterior updating.
(1) **Selection**: Thompson sampling from the posterior beliefs selects a batch of tasks whose estimated success probabilities are near a target difficulty (e.g., $p^*=0.5$).
(2) **Training \& Evidence Collection**: The LLM is finetuned, yielding direct success/failure counts (_explicit evidence_) for the selected batch.
For unselected tasks, predicted counts (_implicit evidence_) are produced by a plug-in; We introduce an ultra-lightweight interpolation-based variant with negligible overhead.
(3) **Posterior Updating**: Explicit and implicit evidence are fused using our generalized Bayesian update rule.

### Usage

##### Step 1: Environment Preparation

Ensure Trinity-RFT is well installed ([Installation Guide](https://modelscope.github.io/Trinity-RFT/en/main/tutorial/trinity_installation.html)). No extra dependence is required.

##### Step 2: Model & Dataset Preparation

Download the model your want to train (e.g., [Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct](https://www.modelscope.cn/models/Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct)).

Download the [GURU](https://huggingface.co/datasets/LLM360/guru-RL-92k) dataset.
Also refer to the [Data Preparation Guide](https://github.com/LLM360/Reasoning360?tab=readme-ov-file#data-preparation) and the [Tech Report](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2506.14965) provided by the LLM360 team.

Remember to modify the model/data path in `bots.yaml` and `random.yaml` accordingly.

##### Step 3: Training
Launch training by executing:
```bash
trinity run --config examples/bots/bots.yaml --plugin-dir examples/bots/workflow
```
The improvement over random selection baseline can be stably obtained 🤖🤖🤖.
